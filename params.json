{"name":"Ios-classifieds-test","tagline":"This is a test project for my First IOS Project","body":"### Welcome to My Project IOS-Classfieds\r\nThis Application is currently in production as a learning experience and to help the community of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. I have seen way no many groups out on facebook that allow their users to list and sell items. The rules of these groups are pretty straight forward, but I would like to simplify things by creating an application that is similar to many of the classified apps that are currently out the only difference is that users post their items based on a Geocoded point referenced to a zip code.\r\n\r\n### Currently in Production\r\nI am currently designing this application all as a single individual. The application was created in July 15,2015 and is currently a work in progress, as this will be my first application that uses Parse as the backend.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was founded by Zack Divine (@chanced270)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
